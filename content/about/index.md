## Bio

I grew up in the fast-growing city Shenzhen, China and witnessed its evolution to a metropolitan city. Chemistry was what I was curious about in high school. But I found my interest in Environmental Science later after being admitted to Peking University (PKU). Now I am learning atmospheric modeling skills for better understanding air pollution across the world.
